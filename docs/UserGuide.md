## [Quick start](#table-of-contents)

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `tutorpro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tutorpro.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list` : Lists all contacts.

   - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@gmail.com a/Clementi Ave 123, Blk 321, #12-345 lvl/P5 sub/math-B sub/science-C` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to your list of contacts.

   - `find John` : Finds all contacts with names containing the word 'John'.

   - `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   - `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## [Features](#table-of-contents)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:** <br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `add STUDENT_NAME`, `STUDENT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add John Doe`.

- Names can be duplicated as people can have the same names.

- Phone numbers and emails must be unique.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  E.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  Items with … after them can be used multiple times.
  E.g. `sub/SUBJECT-GRADE…` can be used as `sub/math-B`(i.e. 1 time), `sub/math-B sub/science-C`(i.e. 2 times), etc.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

TutorPro data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TutorPro data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
**:exclamation: Caution:**<br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TutorPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## [FAQ](#table-of-contents)

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.
**Q**: Error message says input cannot be blank but my input is not blank! What's wrong with my input?<br>

**A**: Currently, TutorPro only takes in commands with ASCII characters. Please ensure that your input command only contains ASCII characters.

## [Known issues](#table-of-contents)

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
