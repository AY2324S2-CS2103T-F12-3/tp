--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `tutorpro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tutorpro.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@gmail.com a/Clementi Ave 123, Blk 321, #12-345 lvl/P5 sub/math-B sub/science-C` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to your list of contacts.

   * `find John` : Finds all contacts with names containing the word 'John'.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `add STUDENT_NAME`, `STUDENT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  Items with … after them can be used multiple times.
  E.g. `sub/SUBJECT-GRADE…` can be used as `sub/math-B`(i.e. 1 time), `sub/math-B sub/science-C`(i.e. 2 times), etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
