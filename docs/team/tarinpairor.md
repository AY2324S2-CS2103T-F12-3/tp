### Project: TutorPro Level 1

TutorPro - Level 1 is a desktop contact management application used for managing students as a **Private Tutor**. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: `addp` command
  - What it does: Allow users to add parents which are an extension of a `Person`.
  - Justification: This feature allows users to add parents which are distinguished from students as it has a special _parent_ tag.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and manually modifying similar code to the add command.
  - Credits: _{This was heavily inspired by the previously implemented `add` command.}_
