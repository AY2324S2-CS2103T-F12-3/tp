### Project: TutorPro Level 1

TutorPro - Level 1 is a desktop contact management application used for managing students as a **Private Tutor**. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: `addp` command
  - What it does: Allow users to add parents which are an extension of a `Person`.
  - Justification: This feature allows users to add parents which are distinguished from students as it has a special _parent_ tag.
  - Credits: _{This was heavily inspired by the previously implemented `add` command. It was designed as an addition to the original `add` command to expand the user types that could be added to the database.}_
