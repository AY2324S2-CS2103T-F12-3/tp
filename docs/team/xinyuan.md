### Project: TutorPro Level 1

TutorPro - Level 1 is a desktop contact management application used for managing students as a **Private Tutor**. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `edit` command
    * What it does: Allow users to edit any field of a person.
    * Justification: This feature improves the functionality of the product significantly because it allows user to 
  rectify mistakes in their commands and also update old information.
    * Highlights: Users can edit more than one field in a single `edit` command which boosts the product's efficiency.

* **New Feature**: Add grade to subject [/#53](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/53)
  * What it does: User can now add a grade to a subject when adding or editing the `<SUBJECT>` field.
  * Justification: This allows users to keep track of their students' academic progress efficiently.
  * Highlights: Modified the `<SUBJECT>` field such that there is more flexibility where subjects with longer names and grades
    with more than a single letter are accepted as valid inputs. 

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Saving and Loading feature [/#46](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/46)
    * Added `JsonAdaptedSubject`, `JsonAdaptedStudent`, `JsonAdaptedEvent` and `JsonAdaptedReminder` to ensure all 
    information are saved and loaded properly.
