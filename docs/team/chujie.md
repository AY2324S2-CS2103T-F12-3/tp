### Project: TutorPro Level 1

TutorPro - Level 1 is a desktop contact management application used for managing students as a **Private Tutor**. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `schedule` command (Now removed)
  * What it does: Allow users to view their schedule for the next specified number of days.
  * Justification: This feature improves the functionality of the product significantly as it allows the user to view their list of events and reminders for the next specified number of days, so that they can know their upcoming schedule, e.g. who to tutor, where to go and at what time, etc.
    They will also be able to manage their time better as this feature helps users keep track of their important deadlines and events.
  * Highlights: Users can view their schedule for however many days in the future as they want. They will not feel overwhelmed because their list of events is too long.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tamagochuuu&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByAuthors&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2024-02-23&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=tamagochuuu&tabRepo=AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
